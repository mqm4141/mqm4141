- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Quiñones. I'm currently a Senior Mechanical Engineer with 5 years of experience. I've always like coding, or at least since I took some Matlab in college. I'm at a little bit of a crossroad since I'm not 100% sure I want to keep working as a Mechanical Engineer, so I want to learn coding to potentially change direction and also realize an idea for a game review website that I've been brewing. I believe most of my experience as a Mech Engineer will help me when it comes to learn coding.
- 👀 Lately, I’m interested in web development since I have an idea for a "new" game review website that I want to realize.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development through the Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to web development. Since I'm just starting, I'm not exactly sure what I will need to be collaborating, but I'll get there.
